- 📝 I post regularly content on my Instagram page [**https://instagram.com/cssiseasy/**](https://instagram.com/cssiseasy/). For more than four years, I have had many opportunities to work in a wide range of web technologies, which has allowed me to accumulate a significant amount of diverse experience.
- 🤖 In this github I'll be posting source code for all my instagram projects.
- 👾 You can also view the source code of all projects in the online code editor [**https://codepen.io/CssIsEasy**](https://codepen.io/CssIsEasy)
- 💼 Unfortunately, I am not available for hire or to work on your projects. But I will be happy to help you if you have a question or a bug in the code.
- 🦾 In the future I would like to teach you more complex things than CSS.
